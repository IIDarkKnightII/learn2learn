"""
 simple quadratic function
 ||X * \theta - y||_{2}^{2}

10x10 matrices X and 10 dimenstional vectors y
 the params thera are also 10 dim

coordinate-wise LSTM:

 each LSTM get one gradient coordinate as input return the one coordinate as output
 all of the LSTMs have the same parameters \phi but different hidden states
